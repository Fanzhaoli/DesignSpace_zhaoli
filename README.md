# Design Space

Project goal:Proposed and constructed a computational modeling framework of "experimental design-cognitive process-data results".

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis pipelines for a set of behavioral experiments and model analyses.

## Key research objective

To describes how to systematically test and demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and potential of this new framework in deepening the understanding of cognitive phenomena through a series of progressive empirical and simulation studies, using the Self-Prioritization Effect (SPE) in the Self-Matching Task (SMT) as a specific carrier.

- `Study 1/` — data and Rmarkdown analytics code for meta-analysis.
|-------------`data/`-Articles included in the meta-analysis
|-------------`S1 meta.Rmd/`-Code for meta-analysis

- `Study 2/` — simulation data generated by the DDM model and the Rmarkdown analysis code of the model.
|-------------`S2 gen-data.ipynb/`-The python code generated by the DDM model simulates the data
|-------------`S2 ana.Rmd`-Analyze simulated data
|-------------`S2 sim &amp;ana_rwiener.Rmd`-Some tried processes
- `Study 3/` — simulation and experimental data, Rmarkdown for data analysis.
-------------`data/`-Experimental data
-------------`S3 ana.Rmd/`-Data analysis code
- `Study 4/` — simulation and experimental data,Rmarkdown for data analysis of designs 7 and 8 based on study3.
-------------`data/`-Experimental data
-------------`S4 ana.Rmd/`-Data analysis code (supplemental)
- `DesignSpace_zhaoli_复现/` — fixed some bugs and added output figures
```

Typical columns used across the analysis pipelines:
- `groupID`: 1-7
- `subjectID`: integer subject index
- `Label`: "self", "friend", "stranger"
- `Match`: "match", "mismatch"
- `CorrectKey`: f/j
- `Correct`: integer (0/1) accuracy
- `RT`: response time in seconds
- `trialID`, `P`, `T`, `W`, `v`, `a`: additional trial-level metadata

## Tools and major dependencies
- R (tidyverse, data.table, ggplot2, papaja, bruceR, ggpubr, psych, glue, and other packages used in analysis Rmds)

Exact package lists are scattered inside the Rmd and notebooks. A minimal set to reproduce R analyses includes:
- R >= 4.0
- data.table, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, papaja, see, bruceR, psych, ggpubr, glue
